## Experimental Group

This directory contains the following files:
*  lib
  *  bottles.rb
*  test
  * bottles_test.rb

Run the tests by:
```bash
$ ruby test/bottles_test.rb
```

```lib/bottles.rb``` contains a simple class that passes all the
tests, so when you run the tests you should see:

```bash
$ruby test/bottles_test.rb
Run options: --seed 12372

# Running:

Have a look at the test (```test/bottles_test.rb```) and the code (```lib/bottles.rb```)
before you proceed.

##Your tasks are to:
### Dry out the strings:

  1. First, watch http://bit.ly/c2p_dry (or grab a red USB drive and look in /workshop  )
  1. Dry out the strings in ```lib/bottles.rb``` using the technique demostrated in
  the video.  It's important for the experiment that you follow this technique
  exactly; we'll wander around and help keep you on track.

    For reference, here's the general process:
      1. Select the two song lines that are _most_ alike.
      1. Select the smallest _difference_ between the lines.
      1. Write code to make these two small differences the same.

    And here's the technique for each small refactoring:
      1. Compile the new code without executing it
      1. Execute the new code (without using the result)
      1. Use the result
      1. Clean up unused code

Your code should look like
https://github.com/skmetz/workshop-cond-2-poly/blob/bottles_2_shameless_to_dry/bottles/lib/bottles.rb
when you're done.  You may have chosen different method names, but the shape of
your code should be very, very similar.

### Extract a BottleNumber class:
  1. Do an 'Extract Class' refactoring to separate the code for the song from the
  methods depend solely on the ```number``` argument.
  (This will be demo'd, so don't worry if you don't get to it.)

Your code should look like
https://github.com/skmetz/workshop-cond-2-poly/blob/bottles_3_dry_to_bottle_number/bottles/lib/bottles.rb
when you're done.

### Turn the conditionals into Objects
I'll demo the technique and then let you write the code.

### Implement '6-packs'
Change the code to return '1 six-pack' instead of '6 bottles' when 6 bottles
remain.
<pre>
    7 bottles of beer on the wall, 7 bottles of beer,
    Take one down and pass it around, 1 six-pack of beer on the wall.
    1 six-pack of beer on the wall, 1 six-pack of beer,
    Take one down and pass it around, 5 bottles of beer on the wall.
</pre>
  1. Now that your code is 'open' to the 6-packs requirement, implement the feature.
